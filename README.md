Analyzing market trends in New York of Airbnb listings
In this project, I explored the New York City Airbnb market by combining data from multiple sources and formats â€” CSV files for listing prices and locations, Excel files for room types and descriptions, and TSV files for host names and review dates. After merging these datasets into a single dataframe, I cleaned and standardized the data, including converting review dates into datetime format, normalizing room type labels, and extracting numeric values from price fields. Using this integrated dataset, I analyzed key insights such as the earliest and most recent review dates, the number of listings available as private rooms, and the overall average nightly price, providing a snapshot of Airbnb market trends in New York City for 2019.
